Headings should prefix longer blocks of text or content. If a heading is not followed by content, it may not be necessary to use.

Heading typography sets can be applied as CSS utility classes to non-heading text or other headings; `h1`, `h2`, etc. However, semantic and visual heading hierarchy should still be maintained.

Pages with many headings and large amounts of text may be able to use [Accordions](accordion), [Active Navigation](active-navigation), [Side Navigation](side-navigation), or [Step by Step](step-by-step) patterns to make the information easer to read or scan.
